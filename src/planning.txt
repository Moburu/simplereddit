Ideas for future improvements:

1. Remove lame blue animation from links
2. Make comments text also link to selfpost (maybe even the whole card?)
3. Make a nice clean icon instead of that ugly placeholder
4. Fix the blurry images as much as is possible
5. Better background image
6. White background on text box
7. Add subreddit support
